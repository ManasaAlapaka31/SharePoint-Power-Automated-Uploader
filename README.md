# SharePoint-Power-Automated-Uploader

`upload_file_to_sharepoint.py`, designed to upload files to SharePoint via a Power Automate flow and send email notifications & Teams channel notification upon successful uploads.

## Overview

The `upload_file_to_sharepoint.py` script automates the process of uploading files to a specific folder in SharePoint and sends an email notification & Teams channel notification. This is achieved by interfacing with a custom Power Automate flow that handles the file upload.
